Inspired by The Visual Display of Quantitative Information
by Edward R. Tufte

The goal is to make the axes tell a better story about the data.
This is done by turning the axes into quartile plots (cleaner boxplots).

USAGE EXAMPLE:

Only x & y are required, everything else is optional.

qsplot(x=mtcars$wt,
       y=mtcars$mpg,
       main="Vehicle Weight-Gas Mileage Relationship",
       xlab="Vehicle Weight",
       ylab="Miles per Gallon",
       font.family="Gill Sans") # alternatively: font.family="Times New Roman"
